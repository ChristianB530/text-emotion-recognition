# Text Emotion Recognition

## 1. Introduction
This project focuses on **Text Emotion Recognition**, where the goal is to identify emotions such as *happy*, *sad*, *surprised*, *angry*, and more using only textual data. The motivation behind this work is the fascinating challenge of interpreting human emotions from text — a task that lacks many contextual cues such as tone, pitch, or facial expressions. 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an exciting area of machine learning, and understanding emotions from text has applications in chatbots, customer feedback systems, and social media analysis. The main challenge lies in achieving good performance on generalized datasets because text-based emotion detection removes many cues that humans naturally use to interpret emotions. 

We plan to address these challenges by training models on large, diverse datasets to capture linguistic patterns, associations, and contextual clues within sentences. Our model will learn to associate tokens, phrases, and sentence structures with specific emotional categories.

## 2. Datasets
We plan to experiment with publicly available emotion recognition datasets. Some potential datasets include:

- **[Speech Emotion Recognition Dataset (Hugging Face)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UniqueData/speech-emotion-recognition-dataset)**  
  - Size: 10k < *n* < 100k  
  - Labels: 4  

- **[ISEAR Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faisalsanto007/isear-dataset)**  
  - Size: 41k < *n* < 42k  
  - Labels: 3  

- **[Emotion Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/emotion-dataset)**  
  - Size: ~2,000 samples  
  - Labels: 6  

If these datasets do not fit our needs, we may curate our own dataset by collecting text samples from public sources such as social media or forums, labeling them with emotion categories, and ensuring class balance for fair model evaluation.

## 3. Evaluation Metrics
We will use several quantitative metrics to evaluate model performance:

### 1. Accuracy
Proportion of total predictions that are correct.  
**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Predictions}}
\]

### 2. F1-Score (Primary Metric)
The harmonic mean of precision and recall — provides a balance between quality and completeness.  
\[
\text{F1} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\]
- **Precision:** Of all predicted “Angry” samples, how many were correct?  
- **Recall:** Of all actual “Angry” samples, how many did the model find?  

**How we will report it:**
- **Class-wise F1:** F1 score per emotion (e.g., F1–Anger, F1–Joy).  
- **Macro-F1:** Average F1 across all classes, treating each equally.  
- **Micro-F1:** Weighted F1 across all samples, reflecting overall performance.

### 3. Precision–Recall Curve
A plot showing the trade-off between precision and recall at various probability thresholds. Useful for visualizing performance across classes.

## 4. Baseline Model
We will use **Logistic Regression** as a baseline model. It is simple, interpretable, and performs reasonably well on text classification tasks, providing a solid reference point for comparison with more advanced architectures.

## 5. Proposed Model
We plan to use **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for our main approach.  
RNNs are designed for sequential data, making them suitable for processing text where word order and context are important. By capturing dependencies between words, RNNs can learn how sentence structure contributes to emotional meaning.  

If time permits, we may also experiment with **Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT)** for improved context understanding and performance on larger datasets.

## 6. Conclusion
This project aims to explore how machine learning can identify human emotions purely from text. Despite the inherent difficulty of interpreting emotion without vocal or visual cues, this challenge provides valuable insights into the power and limitations of NLP models in understanding human communication.
